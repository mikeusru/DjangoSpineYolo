                <li>SpineYOLO is still in alpha testing with very limited server volume.</li>
                <li>This website serves as a test, not replacement, for SpineYOLO</li>

                <li>Currently, SpineYOLO works best on monochrome tiffs.</li>
                <li>Try keeping your image sizes limited to 512x512 pixels and 6 Z planes.</li>
                <li>Make sure spines can easily be resolved by eye.</li>

                <li>You can find the source code for this website here:</li>

            <h2>Add your own training data...</h2>
            <p>This model has been trained on a limited amount of training data.
                If it doesn't work for your data, we suggest you submit your own
                images along with their corresponding labels. It is suggested that you label at least
                300 spines for the model to work with your dataset.</p>
            <p>Please see the GitHub page for instructions on labeling training data</p>
